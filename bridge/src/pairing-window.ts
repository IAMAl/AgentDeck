/**
 * The daemon's operator-opened pairing window — the mutable half of the pairing
 * code path whose rules live in `@agentdeck/shared` (`pairing-code.ts`).
 *
 * There is at most one window per daemon, it exists only because the operator
 * asked for it, and it closes itself. Everything that decides a verdict is in
 * shared; this module owns only the state, the CSPRNG, and the audit trail the
 * CLI prints back to the operator.
 *
 * Two properties worth keeping when this is touched:
 *
 *  - **A closed window leaves no route behind.** `pairingWindowOpen()` is what
 *    the HTTP gate consults, so with no window `POST /pair` is refused by the
 *    same default-deny branch as any other unauthorized path. Never let the
 *    route answer differently depending on whether a window *used to* exist —
 *    that turns the redemption endpoint into an oracle for "is someone pairing
 *    right now", which is exactly the moment worth attacking.
 *  - **The expiry is enforced on read, not by a timer.** A timer that fires late
 *    (a sleeping laptop, a saturated event loop) would extend the window past
 *    its promise. The timer here only *reports* the close; `getPairingWindow`
 *    re-checks the clock and drops an expired window before anyone sees it.
